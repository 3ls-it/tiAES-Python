tiAES: AES for the TI nSpire CX II   

__This software is currently undergoing major changes!__  
This current snap-shot is functional and now uses a salted password to derive the key, and employs HMAC authentication.

__ABOUT__  

tiAES software was developed as an educational tool for the purposes of demonstrating and teaching the basic principles of AES cryptography. It is a simple, straight forward implementation of AES using CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining) with a random IV (Initialization Vector).  

tiAES is free and open source software released under the 2-clause BSD license. The purpose of this licensing is to provide attribution to the author(s), while giving the code to the world as a gift. I hope you enjoy it!  

It is meant to be run on any system with python 3.x and the NumPy library installed. It will eventually be able to run on the TI nSpire CX II with the Ulab library providing numpy classes and methods. It's not quite there yet, and anyone interested is encouraged to hack away at it.
